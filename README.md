# The Web of Data

The goal of this repository is to receive feedback regarding the <a href="http://webofdatabook.org/">Web of Data book</a>. We also provide plain-text versions of the examples and solutions associated with the book for you to try.

Please visit <a href="https://github.com/aidhog/webofdatabook/issues">Issues</a> if you would like to record a typo or error that you have noticed. These may eventually be corrected as part of a second edition of a book.
